# WordCounter2

This is my project on Python. Sipmly from heading you can understand what my program do. My program uses python and javascript to analyze text, count words and give results on the screen.

How to use my program?
1. You need any IDE(Integrated Development Environments) or text redactor.
2. Open folder in your IDE and run python code(If you don't know how, then google how to run it on your IDE)
3. In your browser open http://localhost:123
4. On your screen you should see a page whith heading, text area and button 'analyze'
5. Put your text in text area and click button 'analyze'
6. Under the text area should apear analysis results

I higly recomend run this program on Visual Studio Code as your IDE because i wrote this code on it.

If you expiriance problems during use of WordCounter than i recomend look if your IDE sees packages. If no, you need to instal them(Look on Google how to install Flask and NLTK to your IDE).
